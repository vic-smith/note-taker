## Application Description
- This application allows the user to create, save, and delete notes.
The notes are saved to an array after the user enters text into both the title and text fields and clicks the save icon in the upper right corner.
- When the user clicks the trash can icon next to a saved note the notes array is copied and returned excluding the object that was selected.
